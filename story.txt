Once upon a time, Ebbe, a poor man, had a prophetic dream of marrying a beautiful princess, so he sold all he owned and set forth on a journey. After walking some distance, he came upon a church, and outside the church was a man frozen in a block of ice that the church parishioners each spit upon when entering the church. Curious, Ebbe asked the minister for the story of the frozen man and is told that he was the town wineseller, but had been caught watering down wine and was sentenced to death by freezing. Ebbe felt bad for the winemaker and offered to spend all of his money on a funeral; the minister accepted, and Ebbe departed after the funeral was complete. Unbeknownst to Ebbe, the spirit of the winemaker was so greatful to Ebbe that he decided to repay Ebbe by guiding him to his destiny. Shortly outside of town, a mysterious man caught up with Ebbe and told him, "I will be your companion, and I will lead you to your princess."
